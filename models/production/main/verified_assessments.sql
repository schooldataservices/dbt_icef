-- Verified assessments (iReady & DIBELS): student_to_teacher + main + diagnostic_results_tabular.
-- main is long-format (one row per standard_code/skill) — expect many rows per student.
-- diagnostic is deduped to one row per local_student_id (pick row with richest EOY fields) to avoid
-- cartesian dupes when diagnostic had multiple rows per student.
