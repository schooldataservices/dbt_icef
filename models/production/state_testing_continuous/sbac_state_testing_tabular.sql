-- One row per student: ELA + Math summative. Prior-year ELA/Math scale + DFS + ELA proficiency:
--   year = '24-25' → from state_testing_2324 (23-24). year = '25-26' → from state_testing_continuous (24-25).
-- 25-26 upstream may have Summative CAST/ELPAC only (no ELA/Math summative yet); current-year scores stay null until ELA/Math summative rows exist. student_number / StudentIdentifier on 25-26 rows still filled from roster + continuous lookup when possible.
